        st.markdown("""
        BioAutoML-FAST accepts nucleotide (DNA/RNA) or amino acid sequences in FASTA format. For sequence-based analyses, users may upload:
        - FASTA files for classification (multiple labeled files, one per class), or
        - FASTA files for regression (sequences associated with quantitative values, specified at the end of each header after the | character).

        Both training and test/prediction datasets are supported. When no test set is provided, BioAutoML-FAST automatically evaluates models using 10-fold cross-validation. 
        All feature extraction and preprocessing steps are handled automatically by the platform.

        No prior knowledge of machine learning or feature engineering is required.

        st.markdown("""
        No. BioAutoML-FAST is designed for users without machine-learning expertise. Once sequences are uploaded, the platform automatically:
        - extracts a diverse set of biologically meaningful sequence descriptors;
        - selects and trains appropriate machine-learning models;
        - performs internal validation and performance assessment;
        - identifies the best-performing model and feature set.

        BioAutoML-FAST provides multiple result tabs to support interpretation and exploration of the trained model:
        - Performance metrics summarize prediction accuracy using standard measures (e.g., MCC, AUC, RMSE).
        - Dimensionality reduction plots (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) show how samples cluster based on extracted features.
        - Feature distribution and correlation analyses help identify informative or redundant descriptors.
        - Confusion matrices (for classification) highlight correct and incorrect predictions.

        These visualizations are intended to support biological insight and exploratory analysis, not only numerical performance comparison.

        Yes. BioAutoML-FAST offers an optional encrypted submission and processing mode for sensitive or unpublished datasets.

        When encryption is enabled:

        - all job files are encrypted using a user-defined password,
        - intermediate files are removed after encryption,
        - only encrypted archives are stored on the server.

        This allows users to benefit from standardized analysis and benchmarking while protecting proprietary or confidential sequence data.

        - downloaded for local use,
        - reused for prediction on new datasets within the platform,
        - optionally submitted for inclusion in the curated model repository.

        To share a model, users provide:

        - the Job ID of a completed, non-encrypted analysis,
        - a description of the dataset and biological task,
        - a DOI for the associated publication.

        Submitted models undergo manual review to ensure quality, documentation, and relevance before being added as reusable benchmarking resources.
